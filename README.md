# EngineProgramming -> Vulkan

Welcome to my journey into building a custom **graphics engine from scratch** using the Vulkan API.

This repository is not just a project — it’s a **learning process**. My goal is to explore modern graphics programming step by step, documenting my progress as I go.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

* Build my **own graphics engine** using Vulkan.
* Learn the inner workings of rendering pipelines.
* Explore advanced topics over time:

  * Shaders
  * Lighting & shadows
  * Ray tracing
  * Multi-threaded rendering
  * Importing & rendering 3D models
* Share my progress openly, so others can learn from my mistakes and successes.

## 📖 Why Vulkan?

Vulkan is a low-level, explicit graphics API that provides maximum control over the GPU.
It’s complex, but also incredibly powerful — perfect for anyone who wants to **understand how modern graphics engines work under the hood**.

---

## ⚡ Current State

Right now, the project is at the **early stages**:

* Vulkan instance creation ✅
* Window setup with GLFW ✅
* First triangle (soon™) 🛠️

At this stage, you might just see a blank window — and that’s totally fine. It means the engine has **successfully initialized Vulkan**. 🎉

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** C++20
* **Graphics API:** Vulkan (targeting Vulkan 1.3)
* **Windowing/Surface:** GLFW
* **Build System:** CMake

## 🌱 Learning Mindset

This is a **work in progress**. I’m approaching it as both a student and a developer — breaking down complex concepts, experimenting, and iterating.

I’m very **excited** about this project and hope it can also serve as inspiration or reference for others who are starting their own graphics programming journey.

## 📌 Roadmap (High-Level)

1. Vulkan setup & first triangle
2. Swapchain & render loop
3. Buffers, shaders, pipelines
4. Textures & materials
5. 3D model loading
6. Lighting & shadows
7. Advanced rendering (ray tracing, PBR, etc.)
8. Multi-threaded rendering
9. Engine-level abstractions

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily a **personal learning project**, but if you spot mistakes, have suggestions, or want to share resources, feel free to open an issue or PR.
